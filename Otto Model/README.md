In this file, I'll be analysing the Otto data and providing the relevant scripts and data (at the very least the hyperlink of the dataset)

## 1. Summary of the data
By viewing the dataset, you observe that there are a total of 61,878 products. Each product has 93 numerical features, representing counts of different events. In addition, each product is separated by 9 different classes, listed from Class 1 to Class 9. The objective of this project is to predict the class of each of the products (in my case via basic neural networks), with the objective to understand how a Dataset and DataLoader works in PyTorch. That way, I can move on and use other data and apply more complex models.

Upon observing the points in the data, we notice that it is pretty sparse (density = 20.66%). 

Here's a sample of the dataset:
