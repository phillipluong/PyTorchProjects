# Introduction


# What is the Dataset?
The dataset being analysed is the Fashion-MNIST Dataset. A variant of the original MNIST dataset, Fashion-MNIST is a collection of greyscale images of Fashion items, each labeled with one of ten classes:

| __Label__ | __Description__ |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 0         | T-shirt/top     |
| 1         | Trouser         |
| 2         | Pullover        |
| 3         | Dress           |
| 4         | Coat            |
| 5         | Sandal          |
| 6         | Shirt           |
| 7         | Sneaker         |
| 8         | Bag             |
| 9         | Ankle boot      |

# What method are we using?
Here, we are using RNN. Typically, the preferred method to analyse images are with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) but we'll see how this goes. 

# What are the results?


# What do we want to do moving forward?

## To-do list
- Description of Fashion-MNIST
- Describe how Recurrent Neural Networks work
- Describe the results
- Get a confusion matrix
- Future Directions? (Probably to do with the crime dataset)
