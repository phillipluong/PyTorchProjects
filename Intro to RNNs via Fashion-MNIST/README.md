# Introduction
Another important kind of Machine Learning model to explore in this series are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Recurrent Neural Networks build on the Fully Connected network idea and implement the idea of 'hidden layers', where there is a process running in parallel which accounts for factors which 

# What is the Dataset?
The dataset being analysed is the Fashion-MNIST Dataset. Fashion-MNIST considers as an upgrade to MNIST to increase the difficulty of the classification problem. Fashion-MNIST is a collection of greyscale images of Fashion items, each labeled with one of ten classes:

| __Label__ | __Description__ |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 0         | T-shirt/top     |
| 1         | Trouser         |
| 2         | Pullover        |
| 3         | Dress           |
| 4         | Coat            |
| 5         | Sandal          |
| 6         | Shirt           |
| 7         | Sneaker         |
| 8         | Bag             |
| 9         | Ankle boot      |

Overall, Fashion-MNIST outlines a number of advantages over its predecessor, outlined here:

The fashion-MNIST dataset has a total of 60,000 points for training, 10,000 points for testing. 

# What method are we using?
Here, we are using RNN. Typically, the preferred method to analyse images are with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) but we'll see how this goes. 

# What are the results?

## To-do list
- Description of Fashion-MNIST
- Sample of Fashion-MNIST (including an example of data points and labels)
- Describe how Recurrent Neural Networks work
- Describe the results
- Get a confusion matrix
- Future Directions? (Probably to do with the crime dataset)
