# Part 1: Melbourne Datathlon 2019
This week, I'm going to investigate the kinds of problem that was solved during last year's datathlon to get a good idea of the kind of techniques that will be required to be successful in this project. 

What I didn't know until this week, was that there were actually two different datasets, which separated the competition into two different streams. I will endeavour to briefly explore both fields (hopefully without overwhelming myself) to get a good idea of what kind of project is preferrable for my team this year.

All in all, there are two different streams: 
1. The __Data2App Stream__, which explores satellite images in order to predict the timing and quality of sugarcane production in Prosperone, Queensland
2. The __Analytics Stream__, which looks at Stock Market data in order to create optimal trading strategies and _try_ to make the most money.

It might be interesting to also take a look into projects that were successful too in order to see what was trending successfully last year, and what things that may be important this year.

# Part 2: The Data2App Problem: Sugarcane and Satellites
The main idea of this problem is to analyse Sugarcane farming in Prosperone, Queensland. The main task is to build an interactive app (based on a browser) to provide insight into the production of sugarcane over time primarily using satellite data. This task is to fulfill a number of example use examples for farmers, sugar mills, bankers, fertilser vendors and governments for various cases:
- As a farmer, they could use it for
   - finding ways to improve 

## The Main Dataset

## Alternative Datasets:
It's also possible (and likely encouraged) to also combine findings from other (publicly available) datasets:
