# Analysing the New York City Crime Dataset (alongside a couple of other datasets)

This week, I'm going to be running through an overview of the datasets I was looking at a while ago (the New York City Crime Datasets).
- Previously, I was looking through the crime dataset to predict the number of crime events in future time steps given some prior information. 
- Let's see how I can develop with this, or what tools I can use in an upcoming project soon!

# Chapter 1: Data Overview

The most relevant datasets in this analysis is the crime and complaints dataset, which was collected around June 2019. The data was cleaned to only include events that happened over 2018 (0:00 1/1/2018 - 0:00 1/1/2019), within one of the five boroughs of New York (Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island). These geographical boundaries were defined by the geo files from New York Open data. 

To do:
- Maybe brief overview of Uber data,
- Brief overview of Weather data
- Brief overview of Demographic data


## 311 Complaints

## NYC Crime Data

# Chapter 3: New York Crime/Complaint Data
# Appendix
Right now, I've set this as a general EDA for all 6(?) datasets, but this might change depending on how things will go. 

### List of datasets:
- NYC Crime Datasets (from NYC Open Data)
- NYC Complaint Datasets
- NYC Weather Dataset (from Weather Underground)
- NYC MTA Datasets (from MTA)
- NYC Uber Network Data
- NYC Camera Feed Data(?)
