# Analysing the New York City Crime Dataset (alongside a couple of other datasets)

This week, I'm going to be running through an overview of the datasets I was looking at a while ago (the New York City Crime Datasets).
- Previously, I was looking through the crime dataset to predict the number of crime events in future time steps given some prior information. 
- Let's see how I can develop with this, or what tools I can use in an upcoming project soon!


# Appendix
Right now, I've set this as a general EDA for all 6(?) datasets, but this might change depending on how things will go. 

### List of datasets:
- NYC Crime Datasets (from NYC Open Data)
- NYC Complaint Datasets
- NYC Weather Dataset (from Weather Underground)
- NYC MTA Datasets (from MTA)
- NYC Uber Network Data
- NYC Camera Feed Data(?)
